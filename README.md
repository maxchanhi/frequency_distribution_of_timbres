I recorded a bunch of gamelan instruments. Then, I performed spectral analysis to understand the partial pattern of the instruments. 
I calculated all ratios between partials. All ratios are recorded on csv file. 
This program aims to find out the pattern of the distribution of the ratios.

How to use?
- Defines a range of values, [1, 3.18], usually the min and the max value from the data, ignoring extreme values is also good for calculation.
- Defines the resolution, and the number of intervals to divide this range into, d. Too many or too few does not conclude any data.
- 'gp_range_mid_pt' will store the midpoint of each interval.
- 'fit_count' is the result that counts the number of values that fall within the current interval.
- for making a Histagram, x axis is 'gp_range_mid_pt' or 'gp_range' for lower bound and upper bound of each class, y axis is 'fit_count', the frequency density.
